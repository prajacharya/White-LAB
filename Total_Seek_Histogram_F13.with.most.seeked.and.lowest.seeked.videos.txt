Total Number of Seek Events Histogram F13Casey McCabe and Praj AcharyaMarch 8, 2016Purpose: To look at total seek event frequency across BIO 111 Fall 2013 videos.library(dplyr)##  ## Attaching package: 'dplyr' ##  ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats': ##  ##     filter, lag ##  ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base': ##  ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, uniontotal.seek.F13 <- read.csv("~/Documents/White Lab/F13/Total Seek Events.csv") total.seek.values.F13 <- as.vector(total.seek.F13$Total)Here is a histogram of total number of seek events for all videos. The totals for different videos are put in bins that differ by 100 seek events.hist(total.seek.values.F13,       main="Total Seek Events per Video for Fall 2013",       xlab="Total Number of Seek Events",       border="blue",       col="light blue",      las=1,       breaks=100) Here I print out all videos that had a total number of seek events less than 1 standard deviation (711.5726) below the mean (718.2769) and more than 1 standard deviation above the mean.low.seek <- filter(total.seek.F13, Total<7) high.seek <- filter(total.seek.F13, Total>1430) print(low.seek)##                            Video Total ## 1   Extra1.4-HumanGeneticMapping     6 ## 2 Extra1.5-TheHumanGenomeProject     2 ## 3     Extra1.6-ImprovementsOnHGP     4 ## 4          Extra2.1-Introduction     0 ## 5          Extra2.2-HeartDisease     2 ## 6      Extra2.7-ModernStrategies     0 ## 7  Extra4.3-ForensicTechnologies     0print(high.seek)##                                   Video Total ## 1            02.6-FundamentalPrinciples  1564 ## 2                04.1-FractionatingLife  2083 ## 3                    04.3-CovalentBonds  1550 ## 4                 04.4-NonCovalentBonds  1858 ## 5           04.5-LipidsAndPhospholipids  1701 ## 6       06.2-PrimaryStructureOfProteins  2184 ## 7                       06.3-AminoAcids  3230 ## 8             10.1-EnergeticsOfPathways  1896 ## 9                       10.3-Glycolysis  1629 ## 10                14.2-XLinkedRecessive  1653 ## 11                     20.4-Translation  1787 ## 12 21.1-ReplicationInDifferentOrganisms  2373 ## 13             22.2-BetaGlobinMutations  2369 ## 14            24.3-CuttingAndPastingDNA  2458 ## 15                             25.4-PCR  3042 ## 16             26.1-TheGenomicLandscape  1879 ## 17                Lab18.1-YeastInTheLab  3144     Top 10 Most seeked videos (F13) : Total>1430) Ð More than 1 standard deviation above the mean ( Arranged in descending order)1)	Name of the video -06.3-AminoAcids   Number of seeks- 3230Video by Eric Lander Length of the video: 17:49From the topic Protein structureFollowed by 1 Test yourself question2)	Name of the video - Lab18.1-YeastInTheLab  Number of seeks- 3144     Length of the video:  6:32 This is a lab video that talks about the budding yeast.
